# MapProject-PlaceFinder

This is an Android Studio project that allows the user to search for a place and get available information about it.

This application accesses the user's location and shows how far the searched place is from the user's current location. It also returns the searched place's name, phone number, website, and rating if available. 
This project uses the Google Places API to get information and displays the searched place on a map using the Google Maps SDK.
